We are not set up to support contributors very well, but would appreciate 

* testing on new systems
* help with issues. Just please check in on the issue to make sure nobody is working on it yet!

Just please:

* Work on a branch! If a branch doesn't exist (which is a good sign nobody is working on it), branch from main, and create a branch with the issue number and issue name. Github does this for you if you click `create a branc` on the bottom right
* Issue pull requests to merge back to main, and fully document what you did
* TEST your code, using the right `*-doctest` executable, or create one if you need to.
